CSC4640 Microcontroller Programming - Final Project Proposal

Decentralized Environmental Monitoring Station

Member Names: Silvian Ene, Jack Rynor

1. We are building a temperature and humidity monitoring station. 
For this project we will be using an AHT20 sensor, an Arduino Uno board, a 128x64 SH1107 Oled Display, and some wires to connect everything together.
The case will be designed and 3D printed in our makerspace at FSC.

2. We aim for a range of 0-50 degrees Celsius and an accuracy of +- 0.1 degrees and +-1% relative humidity.

3. Bill of materials:
- Arduino Uno board https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805663781859.html $12
- AHT20 temperature/humidity sensor https://www.adafruit.com/product/4566 $5
- Adafruit 128x64 OLED FeatherWing https://www.adafruit.com/product/4650 $15
- Jumper wires https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805863898378.html       $5
- 9V Battery and Connector (general purpose)                              $7
- 3D printer and filament will not be included in the cost calculation

Total Projected Cost: ~$37

10. Basic Testing - Done in Video, Lacking Tools for Precise Testing

11. Conclusions:
A project such as this need all team members to communicate better and get going quicker so that if a sensor breaks, we can order one sooner.

RESULTS - BUILT A WORKING PROTOTYPE THAT DISPLAYS THE SENSOR DATA ON ANY DEVICE CONNECTED TO THE SAME NETWORK AS THE MODULE.
THIS IS A GOOD OPTION BETWEEN MY ORIGINAL IDEA TO LEVERAGE A PHYSICAL DISPLAY OR TO USE A CLOUD SERVICE

THE DEVICE ALSO BENEFITS FROM USING A SOLAR POWER BANK WHICH, WITH ITS LOW CURRENT REQUIREMENTS, IS A GREAT COMBINATION FOR LONG-TERM MONITORING.

CONCLUSION: 
This was a good project to work on as it allowed me to learn how to dynamically create web pages and how to connect devices to an arduino module.

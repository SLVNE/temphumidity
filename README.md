1. We are building a temperature and humidity monitoring station. 
For this project we will be using an AHT20 sensor, an Arduino Uno board, a 128x64 SH1107 Oled Display, and some wires to connect everything together.
The case will be designed and 3D printed in our makerspace at FSC.

2. We aim for a range of 0-50 degrees Celsius and an accuracy of +- 0.1 degrees and +-1% relative humidity.

3. Bill of materials:
